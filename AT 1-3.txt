Task 1.3 Gherkin scenarios:

Feature: Login Page Additional Test Cases

  Scenario: Password Field Masking
    Given I am on the site's login page
    When I click on the password input field
    And I type "Test123" into the password field
    Then the characters should appear as masked (dots or asterisks)

  Scenario: Invalid Email Format Validation
    Given I am on the site's login page
    When I enter <invalid email> into the email field
    And I click the "Sign In Securely" button
    Then I should see an email format error message
    And the form should not be submitted

    Examples:
      | invalid email  |
      | user@         |
      | user@com      |
      | @domain.com   |
      | user.com      |
      | user          |

  Scenario: Clear Error Message on Retry
    Given I am on the site's login page
    When I enter invalid credentials and submit
    And I see an error message displayed
    Then I clear both email and password fields
    When I enter valid credentials and submit
    Then the previous error message should be gone
    And I should either be logged in or see new validation messages

  Scenario: Case Sensitivity in Password Field
    Given I am on the site's login page
    And I have a valid account with password "Test123"
    When I enter my valid email address
    And I enter "test123" (different case) as password
    And I click the "Sign In Securely" button
    Then login should fail
    And I should see a password error message

  Scenario: Tab Key Navigation
    Given I am on the site's login page
    When I press the Tab key
    Then focus should move to the email field
    When I press Tab again
    Then focus should move to the password field
    When I press Tab again
    Then focus should move to the "Sign In Securely" button
    And pressing Enter should submit the form

  Scenario: Login Button Disabled Without Input
    Given I am on the site's login page
    When I leave both email and password fields empty
    Then the "Sign In Securely" button should be disabled
    Or when I click it with empty fields
